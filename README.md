# Angular ADFS Sample

This project demos authenticating against ADFS from Angular using the [oidc-client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oidc-client).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
